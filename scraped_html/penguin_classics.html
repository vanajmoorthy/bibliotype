<p><b>1. <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/183689/pride-and-prejudice/9780141199078/"><i>Pride and Prejudice</i></a> by Jane Austen (1813)</b></p>
</div><div>
<p><b>We said: </b>It is a truth universally acknowledged that when most people think of <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/11107/">Jane Austen</a> they think of this charming and humorous story of love, difficult families and the tricky task of finding a handsome husband with a good fortune.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>You said:</b> Philosophy, history, wit, and the most passionate love story.</p>

</div><div>
<p><b>We said:</b> A novel before its time, <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/202325/">Harper Lee</a>’s Pulitzer-prize winner addresses issues of race, inequality and segregation with both levity and compassion. Told through the eyes of loveable rogues Scout and Jem, it also created one of literature’s most beloved heroes – Atticus Finch, a man determined to right the racial wrongs of the Deep South.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>You said: </b>A jarring &amp; poignantly beautiful story about how humans treat each other.</p>

<p><b>3. <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/56606/the-great-gatsby/9780141182636/"><i>The Great Gatsby</i></a> by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925)</b></p>
</div><div>
<p><b>We said: </b>Jay Gatsby, the enigmatic millionaire who throws decadent parties but doesn’t attend them, is one of the great characters of American literature. This is <b><i><a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/195716/">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a></i></b> at his most sparkling and devastating.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>You said:</b> The greatest, most scathing dissection of the hollowness at the heart of the American dream. Hypnotic, tragic, both of its time and completely relevant.</p>

</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>We said: </b> <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/9183/">Gabriel García Márquez</a>’s multi-generational spanning magnum opus was a landmark in Spanish literature.</p>

</div><div>
<p><b>We said:</b> The ‘true crime’ TV show / podcast you’re obsessed with probably owes a debt to this masterpiece of reportage by <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/19953/">Truman Capote</a>. Chilling and brilliant.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>You said: </b>In this groundbreaking novel, completed after six arduous years of research, Capote invented a new genre - the &#x27;Nonfiction Novel&#x27; - applying prose techniques to fact. It spawned the school of New Journalism &amp; invented the true crime genre as we know it.</p>

<p><b>6. <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/57281/wide-sargasso-sea/9780241281901/"><i>Wide Sargasso Sea</i></a> by Jean Rhys (1966)</b></p>
</div><div>
<p><b>We said: </b><a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/11345/">Jean<b> </b>Rhys</a> wrote this feminist and anti-colonial prequel to Charlotte Bronte’s novel <i><a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/183657/jane-eyre-by-bronte-charlotte/9780141198859">Jane Eyre</a></i> which chronicles the events of Mr Rochester’s disastrous marriage to Antoinette Conway or Bertha as we come to know her.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>You said:</b> Rhys took a character from a classic novel and breathed new life into the “madwoman in the attic” based on her own experiences/world view. She beautifully showed how the stories we read fold into our lives to make new stories.</p>

</div><div>
<p><b>We said: </b>One of the greatest and most prescient dystopian novels ever written, this should be on everyone’s must-read list.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>You said: </b>Given the exponential growth of AI, Machine Learning &amp; Robotics, Huxley&#x27;s vision acts as a warning. Will we rise and challenge those who seek to shape our future or sleepwalk toward conditioning by technology?</p>

</div><div>
<p><b>We said: </b>Cassandra Mortmain’s upbringing in a crumbling castle with her eccentric family may not be everyone’s experience, but we can guarantee her coming-of-age story with all its enchanting and disenchanting moments will resonate for many.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>You said: </b>A &#x27;children&#x27;s book&#x27; that speaks volumes (ha) about unrequited love and dysfunctional families. Timeless. And funny. (and we need some laughs on the 100 Classics list!)</p>

<p><b>9. <i><a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/34231/jane-eyre/9780141040387/">Jane Eyre</a></i> by Charlotte Bronte (1847)</b></p>
</div><div>
<p><b>We said: </b>One of literature’s steeliest heroines, in her short life Jane Eyre has overcome a traumatic childhood only to be challenged by secrets, strange noises and mysterious fires in her new home of Thornfield Hall. All while falling in love with her employer, Mr Rochester. A Gothic masterpiece that was groundbreaking in its intimate use of the first-person narrative.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>You said: </b>I read this in English lessons aged 13. Jane&#x27;s defiance and courage speaks as much to me now as it did 50 years ago. I spent 25 years as an English teacher and introduced Jane to students as often as I could.</p>

<p><b>10. <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/35469/crime-and-punishment/9780140449136/"><i>Crime and Punishment</i></a> by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1866)</b></p>
</div><div>
<p><b>We said: </b>This novel is a masterful and completely captivating depiction of a man experiencing a profound mental unraveling. No amount of ethical bargaining on Raskolnikov’s part can free him from the parasitic guilt nested in his soul. A brilliant read if you loved <i>Breaking Bad</i>.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>You said: </b>No other novel has made me feel so much for the main characters, so deeply depicted by the author. I felt like an orphan when I finished it and it&#x27;s the only novel I&#x27;ve re-read several times.</p>

<p><b>We said: </b>The second novel in <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/234609/">Anthony Trollope</a>’s series known as the ‘Chronicles of Barsetshire’, opens as the Bishop of Barchester lies on his deathbed; soon the battle for power amongst the town’s key players will commence. Told with plenty of wisdom and wit.</p>

<p><b>You said:</b> This book has tremendous characters and a plot which sucks you into such a different world, about which you find yourself caring desperately.</p>

<p><b>44. <i><a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/24388/lady-chatterleys-lover-by-lawrence-d-h/9780241951545">Lady Chatterley’s Lover</a> by D.H Lawrence (1960)</i></b></p>
</div><div>
<p><b>We said:</b> The story of Lady Chatterley who starved of love from her husband, paralysed from the Great War, embarks on an affair with her groundsman Mellors is a captivating novel with an equally compelling story behind it. It became the <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/discover/articles/d-h-lawrence-lady-chatterleys-lover-trial">first work of literary merit to be prosecuted under a new law</a>, the Obscene Publications Act 1959, which Penguin went on to win and subsequently quickly sold three million copies.  </p>
</div><div>
<p><b>You said: </b>There are so many themes and insights including gender and class in particular. The sex scenes are actually surprisingly sexy, from both perspectives, for a book of this age.</p>

</div><div>
<p><b>We said: </b>An epic novel by <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/4410/">Alexandre Dumas</a> that will have you feeling all the emotions – and a prime example of the old adage that revenge is a dish best served cold.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>You said: </b>The best classic tale! A story of innocence, romance, betrayal, suffering, revenge and more importantly, Man’s triumph over all life throws at him.</p>

</div><div>
<p><b>We said:</b> Perhaps <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/12246/">John Steinbeck</a>’s finest novel, this is a beautifully evocative and, by the end, devastating read.</p>

</div><div>
<p><b><a id="50"></a>We said: </b>Having survived censorship, controversy and even legal action, <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/10941/">James Joyce</a>’s most famous novel is renowned for its use of inner monologue and stream-of-consciousness technique. Whether it’s the greatest novel of the 20th century, or the most unreadable, is up for debate.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>You said: </b>Reading it as a person, an emotional journey. Reading it as a writer, is technically mesmerizing and inspiring</p>

<p><b>78.  <i><a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/280282/a-christmas-carol/">A Christmas Carol</a> </i>by Charles Dickens (1843)</b></p>
</div><div>
<p><b>We said: </b>This is arguably Dickens’ most famous tale. Ebenezer Scrooge, Tiny Tim and exclamations of &#x27;Bah Humbug!&#x27; are as synonymous with the festive seasons as Santa, turkey and Christmas pudding.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>You said:</b> A masterpiece. The ultimate story of hope and redemption.</p>

<p><b>79. <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/184001/silas-marner/9780141389455/"><i>Silas Marner</i></a> by George Eliot (1861)</b></p>
</div><div>
<p><b>We said: </b><i>Silas Marner</i> was Eliot’s favourite of her novels. It tells the story of an isolated miser, who is given a second chance to transform his life when he adopts a young orphaned child. With themes of religion, industrialisation and community, the book also provides us with a glimpse of a vanished rural world.</p>

<p><b>You said: </b>Redemption and love. Beautifully written</p>

</div><div>
<p><b>We said:</b> In <i>Little Women</i>, <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/168531/">Louisa May Alcott</a> set out to write a book in which girls would see them themselves accurately reflected. The March sisters, with their four very different personalities and ambitions, accurately embody both the challenges of growing up and the irreplaceable bond of sisterhood.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>You said:</b> A story of growing up and changing and the world set around a group of young girls. This book is as timeless as it is beautiful.<br/> <br/> Luke E, X (formerly Twitter)</p>

<p><b>82. <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/353448/the-sea--the-sea/"><i>The Sea, The Sea</i></a> by Iris Murdoch (1978)</b></p>
</div><div>
<p><b>We said: </b>Winner of the Man Booker Prize in 1978, <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/165649/">Iris Murdoch</a>&#x27;s book is the story of strange obsessions and reflections which haunt Charles Arrowby, who retires from London’s glittering theatre world to an isolated home by the sea. An unforgettable story, beautifully told.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>You said:</b> This book left me speechless while reading and after reading and I still can&#x27;t find the words to describe why it is one of the most impressive pieces of writing I have ever read.<br/> <br/> H, X (formerly Twitter)<br/></p>

</div><div>
<p><b>We said: </b>Charles Dickens himself referred to this novel as his ‘favourite child’ and many of our readers agree. The story of David Copperfield and his adventures from childhood to maturity is partially an autobiographical novel based on the author’s life experiences.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>You said: </b>I love everything about this book, from the wonderful characters to the sweeping story, it&#x27;s like a comfy pair of slippers that I return to time and again knowing I won&#x27;t be disappointed.<br/> <br/>Alison, newsletter reader<br/></p>

<br/>
<b>We said: </b>Taking the word ‘Kafkaesque’ to new levels, <i>The Castle</i> is a nightmarish reach into an autocratic world. Bamboozling from start to the very unfinished end (the novel ends mid-sentence), this is <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/9042/">Franz Kafka</a>’s finest commentary on oppression and bureaucracy.</p>

</div><div>
<p><b>You said:</b> Written in the form of an autobiography of the Roman Emperor Claudius, <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/21527/">Robert Graves</a>&#x27; novel captures the madness and debauchery of ancient Rome. Both<i> I, Claudius </i>and Graves’s sequel <i>Claudius the God</i> are regarded today as pioneering masterpieces of historical fiction, as well as gripping reads.  </p>

<p><b>You said:</b> Featuring Maugham himself as a character and adapted twice for the big screen,<i> The Razor&#x27;s Edge</i> tells the story of an American pilot trying to adjust back to normal life following the First World War. It’s a gruelling look at the devastating effects of post-war trauma, and a philosophical journey to find meaning in life.</p>

<p><b>You said:</b> A profound story of one man’s journey to find himself.</p>

<p><b>You said:</b> Perhaps a little bit out of a left-field, but I love this book. It&#x27;s simple, it&#x27;s beautifully written and it&#x27;s all about capturing a vanishing way of life as countryside farming turns to Victorian towns... really eloquent, really moving!<br/> <br/> Vicky, X (formerly Twitter)<br/></p>

<p><b>We said: </b>When proud and passionate Eustacia Vye marries Clym Yeobright, she believes she can finally leave her rural life at Egdon Heath behind. But their unhappy marriage causes a chain of events culminating in tragedy, and their realisation that their destinies cannot be controlled.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>You said:</b> I chose this book because Eustacia Vye is misunderstood - as are many women.</p>

<p><b>We said:</b> <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> was <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/10941/">James Joyce</a>’s first novel and details the young artist discovering his voice, craft and identity through his literary alter ego, Stephen Dedalus. There are echoes of his techniques here before they are refined in his later works such as <i>Ulysses</i> and <i>Finnegans Wake</i>.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>You said:</b> Joyce is not only the greatest stylist in English, but the novel contains one of the most complex discussions of aesthetics in the 20th century.<br/> <br/> Donald K, X (formerly Twitter)</p>

<p><b>We said:</b> ‘When it first came out it was viewed as being far-fetched,’ said <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/181207/">Margaret Atwood</a> in 2017. The continued regression of abortion laws and women’s rights across the world has only made Atwood’s dystopian all the more pertinent; and ensures the book – and TV show’s – place in history as a lynchpin of the feminist resistance.</p>
</div><div>
<p><b>You said:</b> I chose this book because it gives a feminist perspective on the world. Also, Atwood uses events from history to create the story, which I find important. History is a circle.<br/> <br/> Emma H, X (formerly Twitter)<br/></p>
