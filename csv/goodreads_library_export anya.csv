It took full advantage of the books epistolary format to create an inconsistent and underdetermined character sketch. The ever changing style and narrative made me feel like I was watching a chameleon made up of shades of grey taking every form it possible could, never letting me get too comfortable with my perception of the characters and their dynamics. Unfortunately, halfway through the book I felt myself getting more invested in Augustus and his friends. Any accounts by his enemies or competitors felt like they existed to explain what happened rather than to add nuance to the story. This made the second half feel like a normal (well written) story about a roman emperor that just happened to be told through letters and journal entries. That being said I still really enjoyed it and the ending got me pretty emotional.",,,1,0
